# Standards Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the coding standards, design guidelines, and best practices followed during the development of the Investor Management System (IMS) project. Adhering to these standards ensures code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.

## Coding Standards

### General
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and files.
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces for Dart/Flutter, 2 spaces for JavaScript/Node.js).
- Write clear and concise comments and documentation for complex logic.
- Avoid deep nesting by using early returns and modular functions.

### Dart / Flutter
- Follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) style guide.
- Use null safety features and proper type annotations.
- Use Flutter widgets composition for UI building.
- Manage state effectively using setState or state management libraries as needed.
- Organize code into logical directories (e.g., pages, widgets, services).

### JavaScript / Node.js
- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) or similar.
- Use ES6+ features such as arrow functions, const/let, template literals.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch blocks.
- Organize routes, controllers, and middleware into separate modules.

## Design Guidelines

### Architecture
- Use a modular architecture separating frontend, backend, and database layers.
- Backend API follows REST principles with clear resource-based endpoints.
- Frontend communicates with backend via HTTP REST API.
- Use environment configuration files for managing URLs, ports, and secrets.

### Security
- Implement authentication and authorization for protected routes.
- Use HTTPS in production environments.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- Store sensitive data securely (e.g., hashed passwords).

### Testing
- Write unit tests for critical functions and components.
- Perform integration testing for API endpoints.
- Conduct end-to-end testing for user flows.

## Best Practices
- Use version control (Git) with meaningful commit messages.
- Perform code reviews before merging changes.
- Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities.
- Document APIs and system design for team collaboration.
- Use logging and monitoring for production systems.

## Tools and Resources
- Dart Analyzer and Flutter DevTools for frontend.
- ESLint and Prettier for backend JavaScript.
- Postman or curl for API testing.
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Conclusion
Following these standards and guidelines helps maintain a high-quality codebase, facilitates collaboration, and ensures the system is robust and scalable.
